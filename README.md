### Features

- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row wins the game.
- The game ends in a draw if all the cells are filled without any player winning.
- Users can reload the game after it has ended.
- Toast notifications appear when a player wins or an invalid move is made.

### Technologies Used
- React
- Reactstrap (Bootstrap for React)
- react-toastify

### How to Play
